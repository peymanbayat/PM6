# Classification Laboratory ðŸ“‰

The Classification Laboratory is a dynamic model that accepts csv data from users for classification issues with a binary outcome as the dependent variable.

This laboratory assists users in gaining insight into data, and users will receive an EDA reportðŸ“‘ based on pandas profilingÂ of the file they provide.

A classifier manager aids in the management of various machine learning algorithms and the selection of the most appropriate parameters for all models.Deploy a classification laboratory using streamlit
